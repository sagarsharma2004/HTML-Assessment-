                <li>MAIN ACTOR : AMITABH BACHCHAN</li>
                <li>DESCRIPTION : <P>The film tells the poignant story of Raj Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) and his wife
                        Pooja (Hema Malini), an elderly couple who have devoted their lives to raising their four sons.
                        As they grow older, they hope their children will take care of them in return. However, when Raj
                        retires and the couple's financial situation changes, their sons, who are all well-settled,
                        refuse to take responsibility for their parents together.

                        Instead, the children propose that Raj and Pooja live separately with each of them for three
                        months at a time. This arrangement causes great pain and suffering for the couple, as they feel
                        neglected and disrespected by their own family. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and
                        the bond between parents and children, highlighting the harsh reality of how elderly parents are
                        sometimes treated by their own offspring.</P>
